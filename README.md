## Background:
Michael Jordan is widely considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He played 
for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards, leading the Bulls to six National Basketball 
Association (NBA) championships during the 1990s.

During his career, Jordan averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game. He 
was a 10-time NBA scoring champion, a five-time MVP, and a six-time NBA champion. He was 
also named to the All-NBA First Team 10 times and the All-Defensive First Team nine times.

Jordan's scoring and leadership helped the Bulls establish a dynasty in the 1990s. He led the 
team to six NBA championships in eight years, including two three-peats (1991-1993 and 1996-
1998). Jordan was also a key member of the 1992 "Dream Team," which won the Olympic gold 
medal in Barcelona.

Off the court, Jordan's marketability and endorsement deals made him one of the most 
recognizable and successful athletes in the world. He was a key figure in the expansion of the 
NBA's global reach and continues to be a major influence on the league and the sport of 
basketball today.

Jordan's statistics, awards, and accolades speak to his incredible skill and dominance on the 
court. His impact on the game, both as a player and a cultural icon, solidifies his place as one of 
the greatest basketball players of all time
